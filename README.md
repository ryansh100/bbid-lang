# bbid-lang / Building Block Identification Language

This project's goal is to create a more descriptive, programmable and extensible way of describing building block parts such as LEGO&reg;.

The system consists of descriptor assignments in Radix64 blocks.

The following could be represented as `0-13-------------5.----------13-----------------------------------------K-----`

This might seem like overkill, but how do you systematically describe elements that combine a variety of properties more than studs and the ability to socket with other studs? To for example clips, bars, technic-style axles, etc... Would you know what I mean when I say "Plade 1X2 M. Van. Hul Ã˜ 4,8"? Most likely not.

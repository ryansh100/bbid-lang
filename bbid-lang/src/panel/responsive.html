    <p>
      BBID/Building Blick Identification is a way to semantically describe LEGO
      parts to find them or catalog them. Rather than having 1-1 names for a part
      A part is descibed by a collection of attributes such as height, color and
      studs.
    </p>
    <p>
      This opens up the opportunity to systematically order parts by other
      similar parts.
